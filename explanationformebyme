i made this task manager to help me understand and improve in springboot

This is a CRUD application.
CRUD basically means
Create
Read
Update
Delete

the process is as follow -
first there is a main application which is used to run the project, we dont interfere with that
2. in the next step we make 3 folders named
    a. controller
    b. entity
    c. repo
    d. service

The logic behind these 4 folders are as follows
1. Controllerâ€™s job is to handle API requests and route them to the Service Layer. It should not contain business logic this keeps code modular and clean.
2. entity is a place were we have defined what all datapoints we need. id, description, title
3. repo is the file where we connect our code to mongoDB, we get pre built methods like .save .f indall()
4. service layer handles business logic and act as a middleman between controller and repositery

spring.application.name=Task-Manager // basically name of the file
spring.data.mongodb.database=taskmanagerdb // we are telling mongo db that this is the db we are using and if it isnt there make it
spring.data.mongodb.port=27017 // we are telling mongo that this is the port we will use in mongo
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost // same, telling mongo this will be the host
server.port=8080 // port we will be using on client side

details about all the words using @

@Restcontroller -  it defines that this particular file is api gateway
@Autowired - used for dependency injection - calling data from service layer or wherever that is stored
@Requestmapping("xyz") - this will be the endpoint depicting that you need to type8080/xyz before typing anyting more
@Service - special type of component made for business layer
@Getmapping - used to fetch/get data from server
@Postmapping - used to post data to the server
@Putmapping -  used to update data to the server
@Deletemapping - used to delete data from the server
@Data -  used to inject lombok dependencies, you get getter setter and few other things
@ID - used to define that this particular data is ID of the project

return types

public void -  dont return anything just do the work
public (file name) do something and returns that file
public optional - it isnt necessary that data is present if present do (whatever is mentioned later in the logic)
public List<> - pull out data of this mentioned list

also, healthcheck in controller is used to check basically that server is working fine and issue is present in business logic or something else
